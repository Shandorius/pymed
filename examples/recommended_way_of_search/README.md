# Example - Recommended Way of Search

This example shows how to perform a search on the PubMed database and retrieve information about the relevant articles.
This explanation has been added since I forked the pymed library, it is the way I (@Shandorius) recommend running the searches now.

You can use [PubMed query builder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced) for creating the query syntax.
